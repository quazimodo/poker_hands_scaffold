A poker hand consists of 5 cards dealt from the deck. Poker hands are ranked by the following partial order from lowest to highest.

- High Card: Hands which do not fit any higher category are ranked by the value of their highest card. If the highest cards have the same value, the hands are ranked by the next highest, and so on.
